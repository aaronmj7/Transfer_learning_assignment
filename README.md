# Transfer_learning_assignment

Assignment Tasks:

In this assignment, you will explore the potential of transfer learning in image classification using Keras. Transfer learning is a method where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. You are required to:

Understanding Transfer Learning: Delve into the principles of transfer learning and its significance in image classification.
Keras and Transfer Learning: Discuss how Keras can be utilized to implement transfer learning, emphasizing on model selection, freezing layers, and fine-tuning.
Select a specific dataset: For image classification, you can choose any dataset such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or any other of your preference.
Your emphasis should be on the critical evaluation of the role that Keras and transfer learning play in image classification, backed by a review of relevant scientific literature.

Your Submission Should:

Describe a specific pre-trained model: Select from popular architectures like VGG16, ResNet, Inception, etc., and explain its initial use.
Highlight the fine-tuning process: Discuss which layers you decided to freeze/unfreeze and why.
Discuss the results: Compare the results of using transfer learning vs. training a model from scratch for the same task.
Consider potential implications: Delve into the benefits, potential pitfalls, and ethical implications of using transfer learning in image classification.
For Your Submission, You Should Create:

Slide Presentation:
Construct a 10-page slide presentation detailing your findings.
The slides should cover:
Introduction to the chosen dataset.
A brief overview of transfer learning and its importance.
Selection of the pre-trained model and its original purpose.
Fine-tuning steps employed.
Comparison of results: Transfer learning vs. from scratch.
Limitations and potential areas of improvement.
Colab Notebook:

Create a Google ColabLinks to an external site. notebook that contains all the code used for your analysis.
The notebook should be well-commented, ensuring that steps are clear and replicable.
Include sections for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, prediction, and evaluation.
Ensure the notebook can be executed seamlessly from start to finish.
